{"text": "Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in From Hell 2001. He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez's mariachi trilogy, Once Upon a Time in Mexico 2003. In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl 2003, playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film's enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the Stephen King-based movie, Secret Window 2004 as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based Finding Neverland 2004, where he co-starred with Kate Winslet and Rochester in the British film, The Libertine 2004. Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 2005, and later in Alice in Wonderland 2010 and Dark Shadows 2012.", "metadata": "movies"}
{"text": "Depp was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named 'The Kids'. When he married Lori Anne Allison (Lori A. Depp) he took a job as a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp's film debut in the low-budget horror film, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.", "metadata": "John Christopher Depp II biography"}
